# Home assignment 1

For this section's assessment, you will fill out the functions defined in
`interface.coffee`. These functions will query a collection of movies - the
data in the movies collection will look like what you see in the `movies.json`
file.

In order to complete this section's assessment, you will have to make the tests
in `test.coffee` pass. To run the tests, run `npm install` and then `npm test`.
You will notice the tests fail. In keeping with this section's emphasis on
automation, we recommend you use `npm run watch` to re-run your tests every
time you change the `interface.coffee` file. Once the tests succeed, `npm run watch`
will terminate and print a "secret code" consisting of a short phrase.
Copy this code into the assessment page in your browser to complete this
assessment.
